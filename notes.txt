There are 6 files in there, 3 for OCD and 3 for CON. The one with the word 'coords' in it, is the coordinates of the part of the brain in 
3D space. The coords are the same for OCD and CON files. There's also a file with group_names, that is the scientific name for the part of 
the brain located on each line from the coordinates file (in the same order). There's a file with abbrev_name, that is the node used in the 
graph in place of the scientific name. Note that the node names are 1-based. The adjacency matrices for CON and OCD are the .txt files one 
folder up. That will give the edges that we would want to see in the visualization too. If you want edge-list files for any reason, that is 
con_17_el and con_19_el in the same folder as the .txt files.

As for what we want to visualize for both CON And OCD:
1) The coordinates of the brain parts, with a feature to see their names and node ID. 
2) It would be nice if we can turn/spin/revolve/etc the 3D visualization and zoom in and out.
3) We should also be able to see the edges between brain parts.
4) It would be nice to click on a few brain parts (ie) and see the edges shared by only those nodes  (basically a graphlet).
